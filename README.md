# Sapphire

### A flat theme inspired by Blue and Dark.



This theme currently supports only Openbox Window Manager, but in future it will support many others.

## Installation
- Download this repo and extract the zip file.
- Copy the **Sapphire** folder to either **/usr/share/themes** (for all users) or to **~/.themes** (only for you).
- Now you can use **obconf** to set the theme.

## Thank you
I hope you enjoy the theme
